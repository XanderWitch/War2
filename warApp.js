// For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR.
// Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. Consider classes such as Card, Deck, and Player and what fields and methods they might each have. You can implement the game however youâ€™d like (i.e. printing to the console, using alert, or some other way). The completed project should, when ran, do the following:
// -	Deal 26 Cards to two Players from a Deck. 
// -	Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card
// -	The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
// o	Ties result in zero points for either Player
// -	After all cards have been played, display the score.
/****/// Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.

//Create a card class with suits, ranks, and values (the values will be used to determine who gets a point on each play)

class Card {
    constructor(suit, rank, value) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.rank = rank;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

//Create a 52-card deck with suits, ranks, and values;
class Deck {

    constructor() {
        this.cardsInDeck = [];
    }

    createDeck() {
        const suits = ["Hearts", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Clubs"];
        const ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace'];
        const values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14];

        //Use a loop to push 13 cards of each suit to the deck
        for (let i = 0; i < suits.length; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < ranks.length; j++) {

            }
        }
    }

    //shuffle the deck -- loop through the entire deck, swapping each card with another at a random position in the deck
    shuffleDeck() { /* keeping suits together??? */

            var randomSwitchCardIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);
